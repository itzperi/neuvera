 **Situation**
You are developing a comprehensive mental wellness chatbot with advanced AI-powered interaction capabilities, integrating Groq API for intelligent response generation and a robust backend tracking system.

**Task**
Implement a secure, scalable backend solution that:
- Integrates Groq API for AI-powered chat responses
- Develops a privacy-compliant pixel tracking system
- Creates an admin panel with restricted access
- Manages user interaction data collection

**Objective**
Create a production-ready backend infrastructure that:
- Enables seamless AI-powered chat interactions
- Captures user engagement data ethically
- Provides granular insights for future product improvements
- Ensures strict access control for administrative functions

**Knowledge**
Backend Implementation Requirements:
- Store Groq API key securely in .env file
- Create separate backend folder for API integrations
- Implement pixel tracking with privacy-preserving techniques
- Hash sensitive user identifiers
